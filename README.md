# TheBeginning
Starting my journey from zero to professional!

1/13/2021

My name is Tyler Ullman. I am 24 years old and from Long Island, New York. I am currently a retail sales associate and forklift operator at The Home Depot. I have committed to making a career change and becoming a professional programmer, so I am starting to learn Python. I am still unsure of what specific path I want to take in regards to my future career, but I am constantly learning more about the different languages, frameworks, practical applications, and job opportunities that are available. Right now, my strongest interests are in blockchain and front-end web development. 

I have decided to start with Python because it is the easiest way to learn the fundamentals of computer programming, which will make learning any other language or framework much easier down the road. I love that Python can be used for many different applications, from data analysis to web development to machine learning. I also have some exposure to the language through an introductory course I took at Binghamton University in 2015, while pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering. 

This will be a life-long journey filled with new knowledge and experiences, and I am excited to get started. My plan for 2021 is to immerse myself in the programming community. My goals are to learn Python, gain some experience with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and complete at least 3 projects to build my portfolio. I will also keep my GitHub updated as I continue to progress and create.
